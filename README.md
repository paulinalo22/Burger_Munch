Node Express Handlebars: Homework 13

## Overview

In this assignment I create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. I followed the MVC design pattern to create the cycle between each of the files, and dynamically generated the html for the final front end application. The most difficult part of this project for me was juggling all the steps that the information was being passed through and to -- and keeping track of variable names in each area. Moving forward I am confident I will do better for myself and name things more uniquely than burger and burgers all over the place!
